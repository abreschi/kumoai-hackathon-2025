# Smart Grocer

An AI-powered predictive shopping cart built for the KumoRFM Hackathon.

This project demonstrates a hyper-personalized grocery shopping experience that predicts a user's needs, helps with meal planning, and streamlines the checkout process.

## How It Works

### 1. Dataset Simulation

* The project uses a Python script (`generate_data.py`) to create a realistic, relational dataset.
* The script simulates **100 users**, **2,000 orders**, and a catalog of **500 products** (dynamically generated using an LLM).
* This creates four CSV files (`users.csv`, `products.csv`, `orders.csv`, `order_items.csv`) that serve as the foundation for training the predictive models in KumoRFM.

---
### 2. App Development (Replit)

* The front-end is a modern web application built with **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
* The entire application is developed and hosted on **Replit**, providing a live, interactive environment to demonstrate the user experience.
* The app showcases personalization by allowing a switch between different user personas to instantly update the AI-powered predictions.
* App hosted at [https://smart-grocer-ui-abreschi.replit.app/](https://smart-grocer-ui-abreschi.replit.app/)
